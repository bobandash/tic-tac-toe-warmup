I used this tic-tac-toe project in order to review what I learned in The Odin Project before I took an extended break.

The project was a Hololive-themed tic-tac-toe, where the AI and Player could choose their favorite Generation 1 Hololive EN members and play tic-tac toe.

Some Notable Issues:
- Minimax Hard AI has not been coded to work
- Responsive design does not work for portrait view
- The Github page on mobile shows the options as a different color
- Text on the options is not aligned properly
- Too many IDs and Classes, extraneous code that needs to be refactored

Things I learned:
- Use of media queries for mobile design (in future projects, it's to always think mobile-first)
- To plan the project out with figma before starting any code
- In terms of time management, this project definitely took a lot longer than I thought because I wasn't able to designate a huge chunk of time to just writing the code. For future projects, I want to dedicate large chunks of time rather than small chunks.
- How to commit in Github (the lines that I committed to Github were not action + result format, but future projects, that will change)
